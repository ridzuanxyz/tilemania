### 5. Community Response

**Top Positive Reviews:**

**iOS (5 ⭐ - Sarah M.):**
> "Finally, an educational game my kids actually WANT to play! My 8-year-old has learned 50+ Scrabble words in just 2 days. Lexi the Owl is adorable, and the spaced repetition keeps him coming back. No ads, no tracking, just pure learning fun. Worth every penny! (it's free!)"

**Android (5 ⭐ - Teacher Mike):**
> "As a 4th grade teacher, I've been searching for quality educational games. TileMania is perfect! I use it during free time, and my students are competing to learn words. The multi-profile feature is great for classroom use. Progress tracking helps me see who's engaged. Highly recommend for educators!"

**Steam (Positive - ScrabbleDad87):**
> "Bought this to help my daughter prep for family Scrabble nights. She's 9 and was struggling with 2-letter words. After a week with TileMania, she's beating me! The AI opponent on Hard mode is legitimately challenging. Great for all ages. 10/10"

**itch.io (5 ⭐ - IndieGamerGirl):**
> "Beautiful example of accessible game design. I'm visually impaired and the screen reader support is PERFECT. Keyboard navigation is intuitive, contrast modes work great, and I can actually play and learn alongside my niece. More games should be like this!"

**Reddit (/r/gaming - Top comment, 2.4K upvotes):**
> "Just wanted to shout out TileMania. Free, no ads, privacy-first, educational, and actually fun. It's like the anti-mobile-game. Devs clearly care about making something good, not just extracting money. Downloaded for my kid, ended up playing myself lol. Highly recommend!"

**Constructive Feedback:**

**Steam Review (Positive with suggestions):**
> "Great game! One request: Could you add more languages? My son is bilingual (English/Spanish) and would love to learn Spanish Scrabble words too. Also, maybe add online multiplayer in the future? Overall fantastic though!"

**iOS Review (4 ⭐):**
> "Love the game but wish there was iCloud sync. I play on both iPhone and iPad and have to maintain separate progress. Otherwise perfect!"

**Google Play (4 ⭐):**
> "Really good educational game. Would be 5 stars if there was a parent dashboard to track multiple kids' progress across devices. Right now each device is separate."
