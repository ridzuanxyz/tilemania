# Archive - Planning Documents

This directory contains historical planning and sprint documentation from the initial project phases (before actual implementation).

## Contents

### Sprint Planning Documents
- `SPRINT_1_*.md` through `SPRINT_13_*.md` - Sprint planning, kickoffs, trackers, and completion summaries
- These documents outlined the original 13-sprint development plan

### Daily Progress Documents
- `DAY4_*.md` through `DAY19_*.md` - Daily completion summaries and validation results
- These tracked day-by-day progress during the planning phase

### Stage 1 Progress Documents
- `STAGE1_IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md` - Early implementation tracking
- `STAGE1_MVP_COMPLETE.md` - MVP milestone documentation

### Technical Analysis Documents
- `SYSTEM_CLEANUP_LOG.md` - System maintenance records
- `WASM_VALIDATION_RESULTS.md` - Web build validation results
- `WEEK_2_BLOCKER_ANALYSIS.md` - Early blocker analysis

## Why Archived?

These documents were created during the planning and early implementation phases. They have been archived because:

1. **Project Complete** - All 5 stages are now fully implemented (~10,270 lines of code)
2. **Superseded by Implementation** - Actual code and final documentation now exist
3. **Historical Reference** - Preserved for reference but no longer current

## Current Documentation

For up-to-date project information, see the root-level documentation:

- **README.md** - Project overview and quick start
- **EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md** - Vision and implementation status
- **FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - Detailed implementation breakdown
- **STAGE1_COMPLETE_100_PERCENT.md** - Stage 1 final documentation
- **STAGES_2_5_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Stages 2-5 architecture
- **CHANGELOG.md** - Version history
